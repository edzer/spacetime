\begin{abstract}
This vignette describes and implements a class that proxies data
sets in a PostgreSQL database with classes in the spacetime package.
This might allow access to data sets too large to fit into R memory.

\section{Introduction}

Massive data are difficult to analyze with R, because R objects
reside in memory. Spatio-temporal data easily become massive, either
because the spatial domain contains a lot of information (satellite
imagery), or many time steps are available (high resolution sensor
data), or both. This vignette shows how data residing in a data
base can be read into R using spatial or temporal selection.

In case the commands are not evaluated because CRAN packages cannot
access an external data base, a document with evaluated commands
is found \href{http://ifgi.uni-muenster.de/~epebe_01/stpg.pdf}{here}.

This vignette was run using the following libraries:
<<eval=FALSE>>=
library(RPostgreSQL)
@
<<>>=
library(sp)
library(spacetime)
@

\section{Setting up a database}

We will first set the characteristics of the database\footnote{It is
assumed that the database is {\em spatially enabled}, i.e. it
understands how simple features are stored. The standard for this
from the open geospatial consortium is described
\href{http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/sfs}{here}.}
<<>>=
dbname = "postgis"
user = "edzer"
password = "pw"
#password = ""
@

Next, we will create a driver and connect to the database: 
<<eval=FALSE>>=
drv <- dbDriver("PostgreSQL")
con <- dbConnect(drv, dbname=dbname, user=user, password=password,
host='localhost', port='5432')
@
It should be noted that these first two commands are specific to
PostgreSQL; from here on, commands are generic and should work
for any database connector that uses the interface of package
\code{DBI}.

We now remove a set of tables (if present) so they can be created later on:
<<eval=FALSE>>=
dbRemoveTable(con, "rural_attr")
dbRemoveTable(con, "rural_space")
dbRemoveTable(con, "rural_time")
dbRemoveTable(con, "space_select")
@
%dbSendQuery(con, "drop index time_idx;")

Now we will create the table with spatial features (observation
locations). For this, we need the \code{rgdal} function \code{writeOGR},
which by default creates an index on the geometry:
<<eval=FALSE>>=
data(air)
rural = as(rural, "STSDF")
p = rural@sp
sp = SpatialPointsDataFrame(p, data.frame(geom_id=1:length(p)))
library(rgdal)
OGRstring = paste("PG:dbname=", dbname, " user=", user, 
	" password=", password, " host=localhost", sep = "")
print(OGRstring)
writeOGR(sp, OGRstring, "rural_space", driver = "PostgreSQL")
@

In case you have problems replicating this, verify that your \code{rgdal}
installation privides the \code{PostgreSQL} driver, e.g. by checking that 
<<eval=FALSE>>=
subset(ogrDrivers(), name == "PostgreSQL")$write
@
prints a \code{TRUE}, and not a \code{logical(0)}.

Second, we will write the table with times to the database,
and create an index to time:
<<eval=FALSE>>=
df = data.frame(time = index(rural@time), time_id = 1:nrow(rural@time))
dbWriteTable(con, "rural_time", df)
idx = "create index time_idx on rural_time (time);"
dbSendQuery(con, idx)
@

Finally, we will write the full attribute data table to PosgreSQL,
along with its indexes to the spatial and temporal tables:
<<eval=FALSE>>=
idx = rural@index
names(rural@data) = "pm10" # lower case
df = cbind(data.frame(geom_id = idx[,1], time_id = idx[,2]), rural@data)
dbWriteTable(con, "rural_attr", df)
@

\section{A proxy class}
The following class has as components a spatial and temporal
data structure, but no spatio-temporal attributes (they are assumed
to be the most memory-hungry). The other slots refer to the according
tables in the PostGIS database, the name(s) of the attributes in the
attribute table, and the database connection.
<<keep.source=TRUE>>=
setClass("ST_PG", contains = "ST", 
	# slots = c(space_table = "character",
	representation(space_table = "character",
	time_table = "character",
	attr_table = "character",
	attr = "character",
	con = "PostgreSQLConnection"))
@
Next, we will create an instance of the new class:
<<eval=FALSE,keep.source=TRUE>>=
rural_proxy = new("ST_PG", 
	#ST(rural@sp, rural@time, rural@endTime),
	as(rural, "ST"),
	space_table = "rural_space",
	time_table = "rural_time",
	attr_table = "rural_attr",
	attr = "pm10",
	con = con)
@

\section{Selection based on time period and/or region }

The following two helper functions create a character string with
an SQL command that for a temporal or spatial selection:
<<keep.source=TRUE>>=
.SqlTime = function(x, j) {
	stopifnot(is.character(j))
	require(xts)
	t = .parseISO8601(j)
	t1 = paste("'", t$first.time, "'", sep = "")
	t2 = paste("'", t$last.time, "'", sep = "")
	what = paste("geom_id, time_id", paste(x@attr, collapse = ","), sep = ", ")
	paste("SELECT", what, "FROM", x@attr_table, "AS a JOIN", x@time_table,
		"AS b USING (time_id) WHERE b.time >= ", t1, "AND b.time <=", t2,";")
}
.SqlSpace = function(x, i) {
	stopifnot(is(i, "Spatial"))
	writeOGR(i, OGRstring, "space_select", driver = "PostgreSQL")
	what = paste("geom_id, time_id", paste(x@attr, collapse = ","), sep = ", ")
	paste("SELECT",  what, "FROM",  x@attr_table, 
		"AS a JOIN (SELECT p.wkb_geometry, p.geom_id FROM",
		x@space_table, " AS p, space_select AS q",
		"WHERE ST_Intersects(p.wkb_geometry, q.wkb_geometry))",
		"AS b USING (geom_id);")
}
@
The following selection method selects a time period only, as
defined by the methods in package \code{xts}. A time period is
defined as a valid ISO8601 string, e.g. 2005-05 is the full month
of May for 2005.
<<keep.source=TRUE>>=
setMethod("[", "ST_PG", function(x, i, j, ... , drop = TRUE) {
	stopifnot(missing(i) != missing(j)) # either of them present
	if (missing(j))
		sql = .SqlSpace(x,i)
	else
		sql = .SqlTime(x,j)
	print(sql)
	df = dbGetQuery(x@con, sql)
	STSDF(x@sp, x@time, df[x@attr], as.matrix(df[c("geom_id", "time_id")]))
})
@
<<eval=FALSE>>=
pm10_20050101 = rural_proxy[, "2005-01-01"]
summary(pm10_20050101)
summary(rural[,"2005-01-01"])

pm10_NRW = rural_proxy[DE_NUTS1[10,],]
summary(pm10_NRW)
summary(rural[DE_NUTS1[10,],])
@
Clearly, the temporal and spatial components are not subsetted, so do
not reflect the actual selection made; the attribute data however do;
the following selection step ``cleans'' the unused features/times:
<<eval=FALSE>>=
dim(pm10_NRW)
pm10_NRW = pm10_NRW[T,]
dim(pm10_NRW)
@
Comparing sizes, we see that the selected object is smaller:
<<eval=FALSE>>=
object.size(rural)
object.size(pm10_20050101)
object.size(pm10_NRW)
@

\section{Closing the database connection}
The following commands close the database connection and release
the driver resources:
<<eval=FALSE>>=
dbDisconnect(con)
dbUnloadDriver(drv)
@

\section{Limitations and alternatives}

The example code in this vignette is meant as an example and is not
meant as a full-fledged database access mechanism for spatio-temporal
data bases. In particular, the selection here can do only {\em
one} of spatial locations (entered as features) or time periods.
If database access is only based on time, a spatially enabled
database (such as PostGIS) would not be needed.

For massive databases, data would typically not be loaded into
the database from R first, but from somewhere else.

An alternative to access from R large, possibly massive
spatio-temporal data bases for the case where the data base is
accessible through a sensor observation
service (SOS) is provided by the R package
\href{http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/sos4R/index.html}{sos4R},
which is also on CRAN.
